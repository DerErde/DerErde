:ukraine: No to war!:ukraine: I am against the war! :ukraine: No to war!:ukraine:

I am Ukrainian. 
I was born and lived in Ukraine.

I love the Ukrainian people and I am horrified by what the Russian government is doing. 

I condemn the military actions of the Russian government!

I have been living in Russia (most of life) for many years and have Russian citizenship.

I know and I love the Russian people, they are wonderful people.

So I am half-Russian and half-Ukrainian?!
I have relatives in Ukraine, in Crimea and all around Russia.

This makes me feel even worse. 

It seems that for the Russian government the lives of ordinary people are not worth anything.

What is happening is some kind of hell !

I am utterly horrified by what is happening.

Please don't hate the entire Russian people for the actions of a few people in power.

The constant repression and arrests under Putin have killed any hope that the people of Russia will ever be safe.

I understand and consider justified the negative reaction of the whole world to the actions of the Russian government. (I won't go into details)

My point is that people in all countries seem to be different. 
In fact, ordinary people from different countries are no different from each other.
No one deserves a war at home!

Also I want to say to all those who help Ukraine, thank you very much for your humanity. Thank you!

A special thank you to the ordinary :czech_republic:Czech:czech_republic: people!

In the 21st century, people should not die in war.
No matter what country, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Ukraine, or any other.

I am against the war.

What's in store for us now?
